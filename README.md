# Aviation Data Analytics Project

This project explores and analyzes over **5 million flight records** to uncover insights into flight delays, cancellations, airline performance, and travel trends across the United States.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze flight data using **Excel, SQL, and Tableau**, and provide meaningful visualizations that help stakeholders understand flight patterns, delays, and operational performance.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft Excel** (for data cleaning, modeling)
- **SQL** (for querying and filtering large datasets)
- **Tableau** (for interactive dashboards and KPIs)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control and collaboration)

---

## Dataset Overview

- **Flight Records:** 5M+ rows (from Jan–Dec)
- **Airlines:** 24 carriers
- **Airports:** 319 airport codes
- **Data Size:** ~1.2 GB+ (cleaned sample uploaded; full dataset available on request or via [Google Drive](#))

---

## Key KPIs and Analyses

1. **Weekday vs Weekend Flights**
   - Comparison of flight volume
2. **JetBlue Monthly Cancellations**
   - Total number of JetBlue Airways cancelled flights on the first day of each month
3. **Flight Delay Analysis**
   - Week-wise, city-wise, and state-wise delay statistics with airline mapping
4. **Zero Delay & Mid-Range Flights**
   - Filter for airlines with:
     - No departure/arrival delays
     - Flight distance between 2500–3000 miles

## Dashboards & Visuals

The Tableau dashboard includes:
- Cancellation Analysis
- Delay Heatmaps
- On-time Flights Summary
- Weekday vs Weekend Flight Trends

## Key Insights from Dashboard

1. **Total Flights vs On-Time Flights**  
   - Out of **5.8M** total flights, **3.1M** were on time, while **2.7M** were delayed — a 47% delay rate.

2. **Weekday vs Weekend Travel**  
   - Weekdays: **4.29M flights**, Weekends: **1.51M flights**  
   - On-time rates remained consistent across both periods.

3. **Cancellations & JetBlue Trends**  
   - Overall cancellation rate: **1.29%**, with **75.16K cancelled flights**.  
   - **JetBlue Airways** showed highest cancellations on **1st Feb (42)** and **1st June (55)**.

4. **Delays by Region and Time**  
   - **June and July** were peak delay months (520K delays).  
   - **California (647K)** and **Texas (630K)** led in state-wise delays.  
   - **Chicago (145K)** and **Atlanta (115K)** had the most city-level delays.

5. **Zero Delay for Long-Haul Flights (2500–3000 mi)**  
   - 7 airlines had no delays for long-distance flights:
     - JetBlue, United, American, Alaska, Virgin America, US Airways, Hawaiian

6. **Best On-Time Days**
